### Objectives:

1. Build a website app that is functionally similar to [this one](http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV).
2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

  - **User Story:** I can see the weather in my current location.
  - **User Story:** I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
  - **User Story:** I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Note: Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (https://) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather.

Mars data is taken from the REMS equipment onboard the Curiosity Rover which is made available from <http://marsweather.ingenology.com/>.
Their CORS headers are not set correctly, so these files will only work on the local machine. To get the data on a live site you need to retrieve the data on the backend server first.
