### Objectives:

1. Build a portfolio that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/).
2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

  - **User Story:** I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
  - **User Story:** I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
  - **User Story:** I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
  - **User Story:** I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

3. Don't worry if you don't have anything to showcase on your portfolio yet - you will build several apps on the next few challenges, and can come back and update your portfolio later.
