			"Nature is not a place to visit. It is home",
			"An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day",
			"Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished",
			"In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous",
			"Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better",
			"The trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit",
			"There is pleasure in the pathless woods, there is rapture in the lonely shore, there is society where none intrudes, by the deep sea, and music in its roar; I love not Man the less, but Nature more",
			"Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion",
			"Nature gives to every time and season some beauties of its own",
			"When one loses the deep intimate relationship with nature, then temples, mosques and churches become important",
			"We are part of this universe; we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts, is that the universe is in us"
