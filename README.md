My collection of projects following the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> curriculum. My personal host site can be found at <a href="https://carpenterca.github.io/freeCodeCamp/" target="_blank">carpenterca/freeCodeCamp/</a>.

This humble page is the center of experimentation and creativity as my showcase for all my projects from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>. I dream of becoming a front-end web developer, and since I mainly focused on back-end development in school, I have taken it upon myself to learn all I can to make beautiful websites I am proud of. To achieve this I decided to participate in the <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4" target="_blank">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge where the goal is to program for at least one hour each day. My intent is to further my web development skills while building up a portfolio both to prove to myself and employers what I am capable of creating.
