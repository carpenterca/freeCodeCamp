        <img class="starcraftbw-img" src="./img/starcraft_brood_war_logo.jpg" alt="Starcraft Brood War Logo">
        <p class="summary-text">Sean has enjoyed Starcraft since his childhood playing alongside his brother Nick "Tasteless" Plott. He started to play competitvely as the Zerg joining several tournaments and placing 12th in the 2004 World Cyber Games. He went on to place 1st in 2005 followed by 3rd in 2006.
          In 2009, after his competive play and while still in college, he started a series in which he analyzed high level players: NaDa, Flash, Jaedong, and BoxeR, and broke it down into important concepts for average players to improve their skills.</p>

        <h1 id="starcraft-2" class="starcraft-title">Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty</h2>
        <img class="starcraft2-img" src="./img/starcraft2_logo.png" alt="Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty Logo">
        <p class="summary-text">With the release of Starcraft 2 in 2010 Sean was excited to continue his series experimenting with new units and strategies, and how professional players would creatively use them.
          The awaited release of Starcraft 2 revived the Starcraft community in the West, and Sean shifted focus from competative play to casting tournaments popping up all over the USA such as MLG, DreamHack, and the North American Star League.
          Sean still has a place in his heart for Broodwar, and plans to continue his dailies when Starcraft Remastered comes out this summer. </p>

        <p class="summary-text daily-text">Sean started Day[9]TV in 2009 while working on his Masters providing both a stress outlet and a stressor. He started by watching replays from professional players and analyzing the strategies and errors they made. Usually, a show would focus on one race and strategy being used within three main replays shown throughout the show seperated into three parts.
      Sean added additional shows throughout the week such as Funday Monday and Newbie Tuesday, where more basic and beginner optimizations were the focus. Funday Monday would go on to become one of his most anticipated shows and an enjoyable start of the work week. The goal was players are constrained by particular rules that usually affects them negatively such as never attacking, only using drops, or Nukes and Seuss in which players has to use nukes whenever they could and announce it with a Dr. Seuss style rhyme. It spawned the saying "Day[9] made me do it" at the end of a match. As the community grew Sean gave them the name DayKnights.</p>

        <p class="summary-text">In 2013 with constantly reviewing game replays and preparing for shows, and a backlog of games piling up, Sean went on to establish Day[9]'s Day Off on Fridays where he would stream any game of his chosing, and often critique the game's design and mechanics with what the developers did correctly.
      Currently he is focusing on improving his DOTA 2 skills, and streaming practice sessions with a coach.</p>

          <p class="summary-text magic-text">Sean is a big fan of card games. He would sometimes talk about Magic the Gathering tournaments or Prereleases he attended and excitedly tell stories from them during the intro to his dailies.
            He hosted a show with Geek & Sundry called Spellslinger where using the latest cards one of their members challenges Sean to see who would emerge the winner while learning skills and tips to use in MTG.</p>

          <p class="summary-text hearthstone-text">His interest in Magic and Blizzard games made it an easy choice to pick up playing Hearthstone in 2014. The gameplay allowed for serious grinding to get to Legend rank, but also the familiar enjoyment of Funday Mondays with fun decks built around some interesting or potentially impractical mechanic.
          It's especially hilarious to see him get lucky with his OTK Duplicate Mage summoning a bunch of molten giants on the field and the laughter that ensues as the opponent is unsure of what to do in repsonse.</p>

        <p class="summary-text artillergames-text">Sean announced he was working at Artillery Games in 2013 as a game designer of Project Atlas later named Guardians of Atlas. This real-time multiplayer strategy game was one that they were developing to be played through web browsers which is an impressive feat.
      Sean would often bring up his expereince working on Atlas when discusing game design or particualr game developer's decesions made in the games he played on stream. However, shortly after the release of it's alpha version in 2016 the company closed down and Project Atlas ended.</p>
