### Objectives:

1. Build a tribute page that is functionally similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/).
2. Fulfill the user stories, using whichever libraries necessary and adding personal style.

  - **User Story:** I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
  - **User Story:** I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
  
My result was a tribute page to a favorite streamer of mine, Day[9]. 

A lot of the work was put into learning how to make a website responsive.
